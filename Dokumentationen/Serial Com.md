## RS-232
One method to implement serial communication with a computer is the RS-232 protocol.  
For this a [UT232EG](UT232E.pdf) and a additional port for the Arduino is of need. 

## USB
Since the Arduino already has an USB-Port, which is serial com capable there is no need for an overly complicated external serial protocol alternative
